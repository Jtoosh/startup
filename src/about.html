            <p>Mnemonic Study is a different kind of flashcard and study platform. Built around the psycholgical concepts of semantic encoding and mnemonics, 
               Mnemonic Study will help you move your studying beyond rote memorization and hard-coding of simple bits of information. We help you train your brain
               to remember what make a bit of information meaningful, and what relationships it has to other bits of information.  
            </p>
            <p>
                You'll quickly find that using Mnemonic Study as part of your study toolkit isn't quick and easy, it may actually take longer. And that's exactly the point.
                Using Mnemonic Study, you may not cover as much content in the same amount of time, but what you do cover, will stick.
                Take a look down below to see how it works:
            </p>

        <div><!--How it works div-->
            <h2>How it works</h2>
            <p>
                First, a couple of definitions. <em>Semantic encoding</em> is a way to process information by linking it to existing knowledge and forming relationship mentally.
                "It is a type of deep processing that focuses on the meaning of the information." (Semantic Encoding - The Behavioral Scientist)
                <br>
                Mnemonics are some type of device, linguistic, digital, literary, or otherwise, that aids memory. Any catchy acronym that helps someone remember the meaning of
                some information, or some visual cue that helps memory, is a mnemonic.
            </p>
            <p>
                With this in mind, each flashcard that you make has a field to put the name of a term or piece of information you want to remember. The other side then contains two
                required fields: the information, <strong>and</strong> a mnemonic device or something that aids semantic encoding. Cards can be made with just the mnemonic/semantic
                and no definition, but not without the mnemonic. <strong>3rd party Web APIs will be used to help provide ideas for semantics and mnemonics</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                Quizzes will work similarly. After answering a question, you'll need to also give a mnemonic or semantic that you used to remember the answer. If you don't have one,
                we can provide you with a few tips <strong>(This is how a 3rd party API service will be implemented)</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Requiring these mnemonics and semantic encoding may cause your studying to take longer, but, in a way, that's what we intend. Studying in this way may take longer,
                but each repetition will be worth more, because you'll be doing the mental work that's proven to strengthen your memory. So it may be less reps, but your mind is 
                pushing more weight this way.
